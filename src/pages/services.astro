      <h2>Professional Web Design & Development Services</h2>

      <h3>Custom Code - NO Page Builders Or Wordpress</h3>
      <p>
        At Oak Harbor Web Designs, we do things a little differently. Instead of
        using page builders or Wordpress, we hand write all the code for our
        sites from top to bottom. This allows us to make very custom designs,
        have absolutely ZERO bloat or wasted code to slow us down, they load
        instantly, score perfect marks on Google Page Speed Insights, are more
        secure and actually impossible to hack, and we don't need to constantly
        update plugins or WordPress versions to prevent hacking.
      </p>
      <h4>Why IT Matters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster load times</li>
        <li>Better conversions</li>
        <li>Better performing ads</li>
        <li>More secure</li>
        <li>Better ranking on Google</li>
        <li>Boosts your Google Business Profile in the Maps Listings</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Better Load times leads to higher conversions</h5>
      <p>
        It's very competitive online, and you need every edge you can get to
        stand out and overtake your competition. When everyone else is using a
        page builder and getting poor load times, you could be getting something
        different - something custom coded and loading instantly. This is
        important because if your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, you
        could lose up to 50% of your traffic because they leave before the site
        can load. They just don't want to wait that long. Our sites load so fast
        they don't have any chance to leave, allowing us to capture more leads
        to the site than your old one did.
      </p>

      <h5>Better Ads Performance</h5>
      <p>
        The faster your website loads, the better your conversions are for the
        ads to send them to. And Google prefers websites that load fast. Faster
        loading websites actually have a lower cost-per-click which can save you
        hundreds or more a month depending on how much you're spending on ads
        clicks.
      </p>

      <h5>Custom Coded Websites Are More Secure</h5>
      <p>
        WordPress and other builders have lots of vulnerabilities and points of
        entry into the site that can be compromised. Like with Wordpress, if you
        aren't constantly updating your plugins and WordPress version then you
        are increasing the chances of getting hacked every day you don't.
        Hackers target WordPress more than any other platform because they are
        easier to get into (especially if you aren't doing your updates!).
      </p>
      <p>
        With our custom code, we don't have any databases or server side
        requests being made that hackers can intercept and hijack to insert
        their own code to redirect a site to a spam site. It's just static HTML
        and CSS files. There's nothing TO hack. We can leave our sites alone for
        10 years and nothing will happen to them. They are as secure as you can
        get.
      </p>

      <h5>Improve your search ranking</h5>
      <p>
        Better load times can improve your ranking on Google in a number of
        ways. The most common way is by just being faster. If there are two
        similar sites with similar content and domain authority, Google has
        stated that the one with the better Page Speed Scores and Core Vitals
        will win.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other method is more indirect. When your site loads faster, more
        people reach it. And the more people you have going to your site can
        increase your ranking. And by focusing on Google's Core Vitals Metrics
        we can create a better user experience on the site to keep them on the
        site with higher session times and navigating the site with more clicks
        to other pages to learn more. With more traffic, higher session times,
        and better click through rates, we can improve our Google ranking by
        showing Google we are solving the users search queries and are experts
        in our field that visitors find valuable with our carefully written and
        helpful content.
      </p>

      <h5>Boost Your Google Business Profile</h5>
      <p>
        A faster loading website can also add extra boost to your Google
        Business Profile and help increase your visibility in Maps searches.
        Couple that with LOTS of 5 star reviews, images, and a full 100%
        complete profile, you will start seeing more leads coming from that
        profile than you had before. The more visible we can make your profile
        there, the more people that reach your site, and that's more people that
        our site can convert into a lead.
      </p>

      <h3>Small Business SEO Specialists</h3>
      <p>
        Web design and SEO go hand in hand. A well-built website will not always
        be enough to move the needle as much as you'd like, especially in more
        competitive markets. That's why we have an in-house SEO expert who knows
        how to rank a website and generate leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forget the buzzwords like "optimize your user experience, submit a site
        map, optimize your meta tags and descriptions, blah blah blah". Those
        are all things that EVERY developer should be doing by default. Those
        aren't SEO services. SEO is an active and engaged process of content
        creation, backlinking, blogging, and monitoring. If you want to learn
        more about our small business SEO services, we're happy to set up a call
        and explain in detail every little thing we do and how this all works.
