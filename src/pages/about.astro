        <h2>We Make Websites With Purpose & Intent</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ryan, I am the owner and lead developer of Oak Harbor Web
          Designs. I got into programming after my wife had our first child. I
          was and still am a stay-at-home dad, and I wanted a career that I can
          do from home and still be there with the kids to watch them grow up.
          So over the course of two years I taught myself how to code websites
          the right way by hand and just started calling small businesses to
          offer my help and have been growing every year since 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds
          to spend thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones
          that did, got taken advantage of and have a terrible website that
          looks like it was built by someone in a dungeon and haven't seen
          design trends for the last 10 years. They were in a frustrating spot -
          they either can't afford a good website, and if they can they don't
          know who to trust to make something great. So I tweaked my business
          model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and
          $175 a month model. It's more manageable for a small business to
          handle and won't hurt their bank accounts.

      <h3>Our Working Process</h3>
      <h2>We Take Care Of Everything</h2>
      <p>
        After a contract is signed we send a small questionnaire about your
        business and what you offer, then we expand on that content and write
        the entire siteâ€™s content for you, create the design, get approval, then
        we build. Generally takes 2-3 weeks from start to finish.
      </p>
